## üìú Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

*   **`npm run dev`**: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

*   **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

*   **`npm run lint`**: Lints the codebase using ESLint to identify and fix stylistic and programmatic errors.

*   **`npm run preview`**: Serves the production build locally to preview before deployment.

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Notes

*   **Design Blueprint:** The visual design and color scheme are governed by the `color-system-analysis.md` file, which serves as the architectural "source of truth."
*   **Component-Based:** The UI is broken down into reusable React components located in `src/components/`.
*   **Centralized CTA Handler:** All primary "Join Waitlist" actions are routed through a single `handlePrimaryAction` function in `src/App.tsx` for consistent analytics tracking.
