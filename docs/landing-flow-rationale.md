## Landing Flow Rationale (PromptReady)

Audience: privacy‑conscious LLM power users — researchers, developers, analysts, writers — who copy content into ChatGPT/Claude daily and care about speed, control, and data privacy.

### 1) Hero — Clarity + Objection Handling + Single CTA
- Direct JTBD promise: “Copy clean, AI‑ready text. Instantly.”
- Objection preemption: client‑side privacy, speed, MV3 readiness.
- Low‑friction intent capture: one clear CTA for early access.

### 2) Problem — Pain Mirroring to Drive Urgency
- Names the “Copy‑Paste‑Cleanse Cycle” and depicts messy copy (broken lines, junk UI).
- Validates frustration and context‑switching cost; primes desire for flow restoration.

### 3) Solution — Immediate Relief, No New Workflow
- Before/after shows one‑click cleanup and ready‑to‑paste output.
- Privacy‑first by default (100% client‑side) to satisfy compliance/security.
- Optional cloud extras (summaries/templates) as an upgrade path, not a requirement.

### 4) Features — Time ROI + Control + Trust
- Speed, AI formatting, customization, privacy mapped to frequent micro‑taxes.
- Power‑user control (headings, lists, export) without complexity.
- Freemium aligns with try‑first behavior; paid value via advanced summaries.

### 5) Social Proof — Professional Signals + Co‑Creation
- Privacy‑first and pro‑workflow badges signal work context fit.
- Early feedback invite appeals to makers who want influence.
- Testimonial carousel area seeds credibility runway as usage grows.

### 6) Pricing — Remove Risk, Preserve Legitimacy, Nudge Action
- “FREE FOREVER” for core value; no credit card required.
- Legitimacy cues (Enterprise‑Ready • Privacy‑First • MV3) counter “free = flimsy”.
- Light scarcity (“limited beta spots”) to encourage immediate signup.
