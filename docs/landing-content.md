Version: 0.1 (MVP)

## Hero
- Headline: One‑click clean Markdown from any page.
- Subhead: Turn any selection into AI‑ready Markdown or JSON — code fences, tables, and citations preserved. Privacy‑first, runs locally. Pro adds optional validation with your own API key.
- Primary CTA: Get Early Access
- Secondary CTA: Watch 60‑sec Demo
- Trust badges: Privacy‑First • MV3‑Ready • Client‑Side • Code & Docs Mode

### Above‑the‑fold proof points
- For Developers: Preserve code blocks, API tables, and stack traces.
- For Researchers: Keep quotes, headings, and canonical citations.
- For Everyone: Faster copy → paste with zero clean‑up.

## Social Proof (seed)
- Logos/cues: “Built for researchers and developers” badge row
- Testimonials:
  - “The first tool that doesn’t mangle code blocks. Total timesaver.” — Senior Dev
  - “Quotes and references intact. My notes go straight into my paper.” — PhD Student
  - “No servers, no surprises. Security review took minutes.” — Eng Manager

## Problem → Solution
- Problem title: The copy‑paste clean‑up tax
- Problem copy: You copy text, then spend minutes fixing broken lines, tables, and code. It kills focus and flow.
- Solution title: One click, clean output
- Solution copy: PromptReady structures any selection into Markdown/JSON — headings, lists, tables, and code fences — with a cite‑first footer (URL + timestamp).

## Before / After
- Before (caption): Messy page selection with broken formatting.
- After (caption): Clean, structured Markdown ready to paste into ChatGPT/Claude or your notes.
